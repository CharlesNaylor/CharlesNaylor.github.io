Currently Director of Analytics for CeriFi, an online education company. Previous to that I've been a data scientist at a couple of consultancies, and before that a quantitative analyst at a Global Macro hedge fund. My interests are in time series forecasting, dataviz, complex dynamic systems and cellular automata, and generative statistics. For the last one I mean both Bayesian HMC and the new transformer-based DL models.
