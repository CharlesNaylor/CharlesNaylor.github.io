<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >While Ginnie Mae (GNM) securities enjoy the guarantee of the US government, they
do not provide a guaranteed schedule of coupons and principle repayment to the
investor, as would, for example, a US Treasury bond. Mortgage-backed Security
(MBS) pools comprise bundles of individual loans collateralized against American
homes. Homeowners enjoy the right, at any time, to pay off the full value of their
loan, exposing the investor to an unscheduled return of capital. As homeowners are
most likely to do this in credit environments favorable to borrowers, investors may
struggle to find debt of similar yield to replace their former investment. It
is therefore important, when evaluating MBS pools, to have a good idea
of which pools will be more likely to experience prepayments in the near
future.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   In any given month, these mortgage prepayments represent the aggregate
decisions of many homeowners as they react to their own idiosyncratic environment,
as well as to general market conditions. The problem of predicting these decisions
grows more complex when one considers that the standards of loan underwriters have
evolved over time. The ability of individual borrowers to obtain loans at
the time of their loans&#8217; origination, and those same borrowers&#8217; prospects in
sourcing new loans to refinance their mortgages, may be subject to differing
relationships to the basic forces propelling prepayments as these standards
change.
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   Viewed on a monthly basis, prepayment is a rare event, and thus difficult to
predict consistently. Roughly 70% of all pools will experience no prepayment in any
specific month. At Nikko, we have attempted to meet these challenges by
implementing a Hierarchical Poisson Hurdle model.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Differences Between Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae Borrowers</h3>
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >Unlike Fannie Mae, which enjoys an implicit guarantee from the federal
government, and serves the general American public, Ginnie Mae enjoys
an explicit guarantee. GNM finances housing mortgage programs run by
various federal agencies with the stated mission of increasing home ownership
among marginalized or otherwise disadvantaged groups. As a result, GNM
pools typically contain riskier loans than Fannie Mae pools. Mortgages in
GNM pools may include mortgage insurance, both upfront and ongoing
payments.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3   </span> <a

<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-40003.1"></a>Data</h4>
<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >In the aftermath of the credit crisis, Ginnie Mae began providing detailed data on its
securities at both the pool-level and on individual loans. These consist of a large
number of records providing summary and profile statistics of each pool&#8217;s underlying
borrowers, such as their geographical area, the distributino of average loan sizes,
breakdowns of types of loans, etc., as well as basic pool pricing information, such as
the pool&#8217;s security interest rate, issue date, and unpaid principal balance. The data
format is ambitious in the breadth of information it provides, but actual
records are often incomplete, containing only a subset of the possible data
fields.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   Another major limitation is the scope of the data. GNM has released
records on all extant pools, but only since February, 2012. If we wish to
examine prepayments from before then, we need another source of data.
Nikko solved this constraint by combining the GNM disclosure data with
historical CPR data from Bloomberg. As many pool details are relatively
constant, and many of the inputs into our model rely on historical market
conditions, it was possible to infer pool characteristics for earlier periods, and
thus bulk out our data set to include more of the credit cycle. However, as
Bloomberg only provides historical data for investable securities, we have no
information on pools that were fully prepaid before February, 2012. There will
therefore be some systematic bias in our earlier estimates. However, we are
primarily concerned with future prepayments, and consider the addition of data
points in rising rate environments to be worth the potential distortions.
Sampling remains heavily weighted towards more recent periods (see figure&#x00A0;<span 
class="rm-lmbx-10">??</span>).

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-50003.2"></a>Factors</h4>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Prepayment models are traditionally broken into <span 
class="rm-lmri-10">Turnover </span>and <span 
class="rm-lmri-10">Refinance</span>
components, where &#8221;turnover&#8221; means prepayments due to property sales, and
&#8221;refinancing&#8221; means prepayments due to refinancing. With the model structure we
used, there is no practical impact to making this division. Some factors
arguably belong in both groups, in any case. For example, rises in home
prices can propel both house sales and refinancing decisions, as borrowers
choose to take equity out of appreciated homes, or take advantage of higher
valuations to decrease their loan-to-value ratio, and thus receive better terms on
a new loan. There is a balance to be struck between the parsimony of a
model and its completeness. In the case of GNM pools, there is so much
data available that over-identification is unlikely. Building on work done at
JPMorgan[<span 
class="rm-lmbx-10">jpm&#x02D9;model</span>], Nikko chose to use a six-factor model, but with some added
structural complications, on which more will be discussed in subsection&#x00A0;<span 
class="rm-lmbx-10">??</span>. The
factors are as follows:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="rm-lmri-10">Incentive</span>: The difference between the mortgage coupon and the current
     prevailing mortgage rate. This is the borrower&#8217;s incentive to refinance.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="rm-lmri-10">Upfront  MIP</span>:  Upfront  mortgage  insurance  payment  as  a  percentage.
     Borrowers with a large upfront payment may have credit constraints that
     prevent them from refinancing.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="rm-lmri-10">Home Price Appreciation </span>(HPA): The amount by which homes in the area
     have appreciated. GNM provides US Census Metropolitan Statistical Area
     (MSA) codes, and percentages showing how much of the pool relates to
     each code. Where possible, we matched the top three MSA codes to S&amp;P
     CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price indexes, and weighted appropriately.
     Where loans were mostly outside major metropolitan areas, we used the
     CoreLogic Median Existing Home Price indexes by State.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="rm-lmri-10">Curve at Origination </span>(CATO): The difference in spreads between the long
     end and the short end of the yield curve between the current date and the
     origination date. I.e. <span 
class="cmr-10">(10</span><span 
class="cmmi-10">Y</span> <sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">t</span></sub> <span 
class="cmsy-10">-</span><span 
class="cmr-10">2</span><span 
class="cmmi-10">Y</span> <sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">t</span></sub><span 
class="cmr-10">)</span><span 
class="cmsy-10">-</span><span 
class="cmr-10">(10</span><span 
class="cmmi-10">Y</span> <sub><span 
class="cmr-7">0</span></sub> <span 
class="cmsy-10">-</span><span 
class="cmr-10">2</span><span 
class="cmmi-10">Y</span> <sub><span 
class="cmr-7">0</span></sub><span 
class="cmr-10">)</span>. This is meant to show
     any additional urgency in the borrower&#8217;s decision to refinance at a given
     moment.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="rm-lmri-10">Spread at Origination </span>(SATO): The spread between the weighted average
     coupon of the pool and the prevailing mortgage rate at origination. A

     high SATO would suggest potential credit problems, and thus possible
     difficulties in sourcing a new loan.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="rm-lmri-10">Burnout</span>: The cumulative prior incentive. I.e. the sum of the difference
     between  the  current  mortgage  coupon  and  contemporary  prevailing
     mortgage rates in past months. These are the incentives to prepay that
     the borrower passed up, and may indicate circumstances that make the
     borrower less likely to refinance or sell his property in the future.</li></ul>

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-60003.3"></a>Model</h4>
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >The past three decades have seen explosive growth in the attention paid to
probabilistic, i.e. Bayesian, modeling. As computers have grown more powerful,
problems that in the past would have been simplified and solved analytically can now
be modeled directly using Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We elected
to use the software package Stan[<span 
class="rm-lmbx-10">stan</span>], which permits fast prototyping of
generative probabilistic models, using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which is an
advance on the older technique of Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Gibbs
Sampling[<span 
class="rm-lmbx-10">betancourt2017conceptual</span>]. Stan is at the forefront of modern machine
learning research. Astrophysicists have used Stan to analyze gravitational
waves[<span 
class="rm-lmbx-10">abbott2016rate</span>]. Facebook has recently released a software package,
Prophet, that builds on Stan to predict time series with multiple levels of
periodicity.

<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   We elected to model the next-month Conditional Prepayment Rate (CPR)
directly as a Poisson distribution. Work has been done using a proportional hazards
model to predict actual payments on mortgage pools[<span 
class="rm-lmbx-10">popova2008bayesian</span>], but we
feel the preponderance of zero values in the CPR data makes the Beta distribution a
Bayesian proportional hazards model uses a poor fit. Additionally, it is not clear from
Popova&#8217;s paper how she and her colleagues account for the large variation in
mortgage pool sizes when modeling actual payments. In order to account for the fact
that a prepayment is a rare event in any given loan&#x00A0;<span 
class="rm-lmbx-10">??</span>, we add a hurdle term, <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B8;</span>, to
predict the likelihood of no prepayment, then regress the exponentiated factors
mentioned above on the remaining data. The log-likelihood function is defined

<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   Next, to account for the evolution of underwriting standards and of the available
pool of borrowers in general, we fit a multi-level hiearchical model, extracting overall
factor betas while permitting varied effects for each pool origination year. The global
betas show high confidence in all values except upfront_mip, which is possibly the
result of the dearth of upfront_mip data for ealier pools (figure&#x00A0;<span 
class="rm-lmbx-10">??</span>). The
per-year betas show strong serial correlation, which is comforting in that it
suggests they are not over-fit. It is also possible to see the recovery of the sales
market a few years after the credit crisis in the per-year burnout betas (figure

<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >Mortgage Pool Prepayments are a challenge to model, and we believe there is much
room for improvement in the framework outlined above. It may be advisable to add
an additional hierarchy on pool originators, as we currently assume that each firm
applies the same standards in bundling loans. We also would like to find better
data for early pool years in order to flesh out our model for a rising interest
rate environment. Ginnie Mae provides loan-level data in addition to the
pool-level data we used here, and we believe we should be able to use that to
complement or even replace the current pool-level data. Finally, we believe
there may be some value in fitting a mixed effects proportional hazards
model.
