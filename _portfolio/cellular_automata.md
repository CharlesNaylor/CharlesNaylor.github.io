In A New Kind of Science, Stephen Wolfram demonstrates reversible one-dimensional cellular automata. Using these, you can create a chaotic pattern that resolves into a regular geometric shape, before dissolving again forever more into chaos.

I have a weirdly narrow hallway in my house that needs a custom-sized rug to prevent my toddlers getting splinters. You can use this code to create a long, narrow pattern that looks a bit like a Persian rug in the center, and chaos at either end. This is how my two-year-old learned the words 'order' and 'chaos'.

To make things more interesting, the basic binary pattern can be translated into XML nodes and edges and fed into <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/knotter/">Knotter</a>, provided you're willing to take the risk of downloading something from SourceForge.
